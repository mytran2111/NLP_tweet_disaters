# Tweet Disasters Detection 

 Create a ML model to predict which tweets are alerting about real disaters. An example of a disaster tweet will contain hashtag like #earthquake, #COVID, #pandemic, etc compared to a normal tweet such as "What is up man"\
 In this project, I have performed data preprocessing, data cleaning such as removing extra space, hashtag, https link,...\
 Also, I have implemented three different models : simple linear classifier with count vectorizers of words, Logistic Regression with K-fold cross validation and Grid Search CV for best parameters, BERT model. 
 For the first two models, I got accuracy of 78% and 79.9% respectively. The BERT model is the best one which with some data cleaning has achieved accuary of 82.8%.
